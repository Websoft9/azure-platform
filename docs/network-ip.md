3. If the VM does not have a public IP address entry (or is empty), you need to refer to the next section to mount a public IP address.

## Mount

When the created VM does not have a public IP address, as long as there is a free (or newly purchased) public IP address, the Azure console can mount the public network IP address to the virtual machine. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Login Azure Portal
2. Open the VM->Networking, then the Network Interface item
