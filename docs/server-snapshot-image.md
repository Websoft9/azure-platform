# Snapshot and Image

The reason we put snapshots and image together is because there is a certain relationship between the two, and even there is an alternate relationship.

## Relationship

A snapshot is a "photographing" of a disk. As the name suggests, it is to back up the data of a disk at a certain point in time. It is a backup method.

Following key information points are listed:

* A snapshot can be created based on the disk.
* A image can be created based on a snapshot, and the image cannot be directly converted into a snapshot.
* Based on the image, you can create a VM directly, and you can create a image directly based on the VM.
